# webscrapping-challenge

This challenge included exploring the features of webscrapping and browser automation given by BeautifulSoup4 and splinter respectively. During Part 1 we accessed the Mars website nad extracted all the titles and and article previews in a list. 

For Part 2 we extracted a table and stored it in a DataFrame. We were able to conduct some analysis related to duration, temperature, and the length of a Martian year. 

A csv version of the DataFrame was exported into the "export" folder.
